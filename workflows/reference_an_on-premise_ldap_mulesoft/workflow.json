  "description": "It is common for identity lifecycle processes to require advanced calculations when managing user profiles- including calculations that involve data not present immediately within the identity platform itself. Examples include calculating unique usernames/email addresses and determining proper mailstop values. This template is an example of referring to an LDAP repository to perform a generic search within Okta workflows.  It can be modified and applied to any sort of repository such as a SQL database.",
