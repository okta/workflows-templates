  "description": "Identifying inactive users is a great way to determine if you have stale accounts in your Okta tenant that might have been missed by some manual deprovisioning process. It can also help to free up expensive application licenses. This template searches for all active users in Okta whose last login date is before a specified time window and writes details about the user to a table in Workflows. Data in the table can easily be exported to a CSV file for downloading or attaching to an email for periodic reporting. A simple enhancement of this template could suspend the inactive users as well.",
