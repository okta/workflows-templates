{"name":"identify_inactive_okta_users","title":"Identify inactive Okta users","description":"You can determine whether your Okta tenant has stale accounts that were otherwise missed by a manual deprovisioning process using specific criteria to identify inactive users. This task can then allow expensive application licenses, for example, to become available to other users. This template searches for all users in an Okta tenant whose last login date was before a certain date, and writes information about those users to a table in Workflows. The data in the table can be exported to a CSV file as a download, or as an attachment to an email for periodic reporting. An additional enhancement to this template can also be the suspension of inactive users.","connectors":["okta"],"details":{"stashCount":1,"flowCount":2},"links":[{"destination":"https://github.com/okta/workflows-templates/blob/master/workflows/identify_inactive_okta_users/readme.md","title":"Setup Documentation"}]}
