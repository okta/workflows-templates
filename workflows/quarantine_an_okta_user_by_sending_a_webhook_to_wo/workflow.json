  "description": "Taking action on compromised accounts helps increase the security posture of any organization. External systems like Splunk constantly analyze data, searching for specific patterns that could indicate a compromised account. If an account is identified, organizations could quarantine the account and prevent further access to critical applications.  When exposed as a webhook, this flow can be invoked by external systems and help with incident response efforts by quickly adding the user to a quarantine group associated with individual Application Sign-on policies to deny access to the application. At the end of the flow, Okta will clear the user session, forcing the user to re-authenticate. The user is now be limited to access only the applications that are not associated with the quarantined event.  This Worfklow could be extended to notify the end-user, managers, or administrators through emails or messages to collaboration tools, such as Slack or Microsoft Teams.",
