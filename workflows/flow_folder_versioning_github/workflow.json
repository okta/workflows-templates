  "description": "Versioning for Flows and Folders will allow a workflow builder to back-up their flows on an on-demand or automated basis to an external system like Github or Google Drive. In order to enable this, we’ve created new functions to Export either a Flow or Folder and have enhanced our Github connector to allow a builder to make commits and open pull requests. We’ve also shipped a set of Templates that can be easily imported into your environment that walks you through exactly how to version both flows and folders.",
