  "description": "This template uses an event hook that triggers the workflow when Okta Verify sends a push notification. This flow checks the geolocation (city, state, and country) of both the sign-in request (source) and the successful Okta Verify push (destination). If the city is different, the flow continues to gather information for a security team investigation. You can easily modify this flow to notify other downstream applications based on business needs.",
