# Send Email Notifications with Office 365


## <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Overview</span>

This workflow sends an email notification with Office 365 when a user is suspended in Okta. It allows administrators to easily track user suspensions. This is a generic notifications template - you can easily swap out both the event or the email provider (to Gmail) based on your notifications use case.

Before you get started, here are the things you will need:



*   Access to an Okta tenant with Okta Workflows enabled for your org
