# Send a Slack Message with Blocks

## Overview

This template uses Slack's [Block UI framework](https://api.slack.com/block-kit) to create structured and visually appealing messages. Its flexible design enables you to customize message content and formatting to meet your specific organizational needs.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, here are the things you need:

- Access to an Okta tenant with Okta Workflows enabled.
- A Slack connector connected on your Okta tenant. See [Authorize your Slack account](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=wf&id=ext-slack-misc-authorization)

## Setup Steps

- No custom logic is needed to use the template. Simply follow the instructions within the flow.
- Experiment with the **Object - Construct** card by using different components that can be stacked and arranged to create app layouts.
- Use the flow as a reference point for creating your own custom flows.

## Limitations & Known Issues
