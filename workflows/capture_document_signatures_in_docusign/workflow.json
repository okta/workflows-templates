  "description": "Many organizations use DocuSign to control agreements – such as Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs), Lease Contracts, and Terms of Service (TOS) – that dictate which resources users can access. This template leverages DocuSign webhooks to capture when a user signs a document. This information can be used by Okta to populate an attribute which can in turn be used to manage group and application access.",
