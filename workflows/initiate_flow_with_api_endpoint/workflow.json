  "description": "The Okta Workflow feature is a powerful tool to implement custom business logic. A popular integration is instead of creating an object directly into Okta (i.e. user, application or group ) with the Okta REST APIs, is to send the object request along with itâ€™s JSON payload to Workflows. Then custom business logic such as checking existing objects in Okta or reaching out to a 3rd party to verify data can be accomplished. Based on the results of the dynamic logic, decisions can be made by Workflows providing distinct processing options.",
