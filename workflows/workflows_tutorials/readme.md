# Workflows tutorials

## Overview

The **Workflows tutorials** template is a comprehensive guide designed to enhance your experience with Okta Workflows. This resource demonstrates the powerful automation capabilities of flows to both beginners and advanced users. Integrating this template into your Okta preview organization gives you access to sample users and a suite of flows showing the versatility and efficiency of Okta Workflows.

## Prerequisites

Before you start with the Workflows tutorials, ensure you have the following:

- Access to an Okta tenant with Okta Workflows enabled.
- Okta connector connected to your Okta tenant. See the [Authorization](https://help.okta.com/wf/en-us/content/topics/workflows/connector-reference/okta/overviews/authorization.htm) documentation. 

## Setup Steps

1. For these tutorials, you first need to create sample users. Open the **Workflows tutorials** folder. Open the **Helper flow for Step 1**. In here, you need to add the connection to your Okta tenant on the **Create User** card. Click **Save** to confirm the update and then turn the flow on.
1. Open **[Step 1] Create Sample Users** and click **Run**. This adds the sample users to your Okta org. You can return to the main **Flow Builder** view and run the rest of the templates.

- No custom logic is needed to use the templates. Simply follow the instructions within each flow.
- Some tutorial flows require you to have a connection to execute. Click **Choose Connection** on the card and select the Okta connection you made in the **Prerequisites** section. Click **Save** to confirm the update and then turn the flow on.
- Experiment with the sample users and flows to understand how they work.
- Use the flows as a reference or starting point for creating your own custom flows.

## Testing the Flows

1. In your Workflows console, open any of the subfolders inside from the **Workflows tutorials** folder.
1. Activate both the flows and any helper flows contained in the folder.
1. Open the flows to see how they work and follow any specific instructions provided within the flow for testing.
1. As the flow executes, the **Execution History** view shows how the flow operates and the results it produces. You can return to the **Flow** view, modify your cards, and run the flow again. The **Execution History** shows the results for each separate run.

## Limitations & Known Issues

- This template is designed for educational purposes and may need to be adjusted for production use.
- The sample users and data included in the template are for demonstration purposes and should be treated accordingly.
