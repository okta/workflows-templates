  "description": "More companies are using multiple Office 365 tenants. This is especially evident in M&A activities. As a result, users need access across multiple tenants. Many are solving the licensing aspect of this issue through a Microsoft Guest account. But automating the creation and management of these users is cumbersome. This Flow will get you started with creating guest accounts with no code nor special infrastructure to host code.",
