  "description": "Many organizations utilize contractors in addition to full time employees. A contractor typically has a contract expiry date. This is the date when their current contract is due to expire. Certain people within the organization, such as the contractor's manager, need to be notified ahead of the expiry date so they can potentially renew the employee's contract.",
