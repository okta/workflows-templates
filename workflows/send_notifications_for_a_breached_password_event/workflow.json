  "description": "This template provides a sample workflow to notify users when their credentials have appeared in a list of breached credentials. The Okta System Log records this as a Breached Password (security.breached_credential.detected) event. The template uses an event hook to trigger an API endpoint and start the flow. Then it composes a notification message and sends it to your user through the Gmail and Slack connectors. This template also serves as a useful reference guide for using event hooks alongside Okta Workflows.",
