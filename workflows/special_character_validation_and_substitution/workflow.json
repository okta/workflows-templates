    "description": "When using a userâ€™s name to generate technical fields such as samAccountName and email addresses, often the data will contain characters that are invalid in the specified data field (for example, a space in an email address). This workflow identifies some of the most common special characters and provides substitutions. The validated or repaired name is then placed in a user profile attribute in Okta to allow for preservation of the original name for display purposes, and utilization of the updated name for technical purposes.",
