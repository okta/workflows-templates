  "description": "Many organizations use Adobe Sign to control agreements – such as Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs), Lease Contracts, and Terms of Service (TOS) – that dictate which resources users can access. This template leverages Adobe Sign webhooks to capture when a user signed a document. This information can be used by Okta to determine which systems a user can access and their security level.",
