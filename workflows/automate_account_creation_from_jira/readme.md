# Automate Account Creation from Jira

## Overview

Onboarding new employees is a complex process that requires inputs from several internal teams and integration across different tools for approval and account creation. In addition, certain businesses may require new employees to complete an orientation or pass a certification
before activating a user account. This complexity adds overhead for IT Admins - keeping track of approvals and then activating each user account on a specific date. How can this process get automated, reduce human error and enhance security posture?

This template provides an example for automating account creation and activation in Okta triggered by an approved service request in Jira.

## Prerequisites

1.  Access to an Okta tenant with Okta Workflows enabled.
2.  Jira Software & Jira Service Management. Access to create new project, service request and custom fields.  
3.  [API Key token for your Atlassian account](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/)

## Setup Steps

H. Search issues using JQL using [Jira Query Language (JQL)](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://support.atlassian.com/jira-service-management-cloud/docs/use-advanced-search-with-jira-query-language-jql/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1637340157223000&amp;usg=AOvVaw28z4FtwXAqNWiT6hB3yC2x), find all Service requests of type **Onboard New Employee** in project **helpdesk** with resolution **Approved**. Below is the JQL included in the template.  

`project = helpdesk AND  "Request Type" = "Onboard New Employee" AND
"resolution" = "Approved"`
  
### Okta Workflows
   
#### Brief description of each Flow

-   **Store new employees from Jira**: This Flow is automatically triggered when an issue (that meets the JQL) is updated in Jira. This flow stores information about the new employee in the *New Employee* table.
-   **Find employees starting now**: This Flow should be scheduled (example: every hour) This Flow retrieves rows from **New Employee** table based on new employee start day and time.
-   **Create and activate new employee accounts**: This helper Flow creates and activated new users.
