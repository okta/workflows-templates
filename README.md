Welcome to Templates for Workflows!

Templates are pre-built automated business processes that can be imported in Okta Workflows. New workflow templates submitted to this repo can be published to the Okta Workflows console.

## Getting Started

#### How to submit Workflows Template

*   Open Okta Workflows and design the intended business process. This can be distributed across one or more workflows and tables. Keep all related workflows and tables in the same folder. 
*   Export the folder containing the business process by clicking the gear icon on the folder and selecting Export. 
    *   Rename this file to workflow.flopack
*   Next, weâ€™re going to create the files necessary for submitting your template to this repository. Each template will have three files: the template, a readme, and a workflow.json file that stores some metadata. You can find an example of the structure [here](https://github.com/arvilnagpal-okta/suspend-inactive-users). 
*   Create a workflow.json file with the following information. 
    *   _name_ - The name of your template. Treat this as a unique identifier (eg suspend_inactive_users)
    *   _title_ - The title of workflows template that will appear in the product. 
    *   _description_ - template description
    *   _connectors_ - list of connectors used by this template. Connector names are app names seen in workflows designer. Connector names should be in lower case. You can find a list of the connector names here. [insert link to readme doc]  
    *   _links_ - Links to documentation or videos for this template 
*   Finally, create a README.md file that has the setup documentation for your template. It should be written in markdown and follow the structure outlined [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a1jQ9o2am9pBfx0LsexiQ0HW8qyOU7WFAEg1Eevjinc/edit).    
*   Use following directory structure to organize workflow.flopack, workflow.json and connector.json workflows/ &lt;my_shared_workflow>/ workflow.json workflow.flopack README,md
*   Create a new folder under the following directory. Place the three files (readme, workflow.json, and workflow.flopack) into this new folder. 
    *   [https://github.com/okta/workflows-templates/workflows](https://github.com/okta/workflows-templates/tree/master/workflows)/[your new folder]
